# Project Name: Multimedia Builder

## Project Overview
This project focuses on various multimedia processing tasks using different tools and libraries. The pipeline allows users to process different types of media (audio, image, and video) in a flexible way. It uses a configuration-driven approach where pipelines and activities are specified in JSON files.

## Project Setup

Before running the project, ensure that you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Follow the steps below to set up the environment and install the required dependencies.

---

## Python Environment Preparation

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
To avoid conflicts with other projects, it's recommended to create a virtual environment.

You can create a virtual environment using `venv` (comes with Python):

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

#### On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

After activating the virtual environment, you can install all the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt`.

---

## Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the dependencies:

1. Make sure you are in the root directory of the project (where `requirements.txt` is located).
2. Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install the following dependencies:
- `wheel`
- `TTS`
- `pydub`
- `moviepy`
- `Pillow`
- `opencv-python`
- `torch`
- `diffusers`
- `transformers`
- `accelerate`

---

## Usage

### Running the Project
After the dependencies are installed and the environment is set up, you can run the project with:

```bash
python runner.py
```

This will execute the pipeline based on the configuration in `manager.json` and will log the process to the file specified.

## Supported Handlers and Commands

The project supports the following handlers and commands:

### Handlers:
1. **TTS (Text-to-Speech Handler)**: 
   - **Command**: `generate_speech`
   - **Description**: Generates speech from a given text.

2. **SDP (Stable Diffusion Processor)**: 
   - **Command**: `generate_image`
   - **Description**: Generates images based on textual descriptions.

3. **MoviePy Handler**:
   - **Command**: `process_video`
   - **Description**: Performs video-related tasks like editing, transformation, etc.

### Example Commands:
- `generate_speech`: Converts text into speech.
- `generate_image`: Generates an image based on a textual description.
- `process_video`: Processes video files based on specified actions.
